      "question": "Where can I find a teacher?",
      "answer": "Our website will list some teachers but it will not be a conclusive list. Anyone that can teach Kirtan on a stringed instrument should be able to teach this curriculum. We recommend that teachers complete the official certified teacher training course to become familiar with the examination system. However, your teacher does not need to be certified to deliver the course. "

      "question": "Do I have to pass each grade before moving on to the next?",
      "answer": "It is STRONGLY recommended that you pass each grade before moving onto the next. However, it is not a pre-requisite to have to have passed a previous grade before moving on. Please consult, and rely on the judgement of your tutor to determine whether you can move onto a new grade without having passed a previous grade."
