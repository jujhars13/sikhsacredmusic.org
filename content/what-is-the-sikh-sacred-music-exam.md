    <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
        The Sikh Sacred Music exam is a way to officially certify your skills with traditional instruments like the dilraba (dilrabā),
        taus, israj (isrāj), tarsehnai (tārsèhnaī) and sarangi (sarañgī). The internationally recognised nine-grade syllabus allows students to benefit from formal recognition of their ability, offering benefits such as UCAS tariff points. With the Sikh Sacred Music course being recognised on a global stage, the accreditation offered has become the first grading system to measure student ability and progress worldwide for these instruments.

        The exam aims to cultivate interest in the rich tradition of Sikh music by introducing students to different ragas, taals, and compositions as they progress through the grades. Within each grade book there are exercises to help keep rhythm, develop vocals, strengthen confidence on the instrument, and finally perform kirtan. Under the tutelage of an Ustad (teacher), students will prepare for these components of the exam and submit the examination online making the course accessible around the globe.
